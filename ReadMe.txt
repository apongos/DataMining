Motivation for Clustering:
	Cluster visualization techniques, such as  multidimensional scaling, groups high dimensional data into a user friendly format, which can inform geo-spatial points of interest. As a general example, this could also be used by online social network sites such as twitter, facebook, instagram, Yik Yak etc. to better inform their harassment filters to protect targeted groups. For example, Emory University banned Yik Yak some time ago because its dense online harassment. Whereas, if this information/filtering system was available, alternative intervention methods could have been implemented.  Furthermore, combining this clustering algorithm with the geolocation and NLP backend, we could determine what types of harrassments are more prevalent on certain college campuses than other college campuses . With this information, we could inform universities what types of diversity and inclusion resources to best to invest in, such as sexual assault prevention or micro-aggression prevention programs/consultants.
